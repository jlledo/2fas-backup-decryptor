# 2FAS Backup Decryptor

A program for decrypting 2FAS backups.

I thank [elliotwutingfeng/2fas-backup-decryptor](https://github.com/elliotwutingfeng/2fas-backup-decryptor) for figuring out the necessary algorithms.

## Usage

```shell
decrypt-2fas-backup <FILE>
```

You will be prompted for your password on STDIN and the decrypted vault will be printed to STDOUT.
